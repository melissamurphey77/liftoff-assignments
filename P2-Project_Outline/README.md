## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For my project, I am going to make an app that will create one place for park information. I have yet to find a single site that has parks from the metro area searchable by category. One usually has to scroll after searching though Google, clicking on this site, that site. It can be time consuming when you are out and about. Especially if you are out on a whim. Having family with special needs is what inspired me to make the app.

What if you would like to find a dog park or a park for special needs? What if you wanted both? This app would have the ability to filter amenities such as playground, shelters, dog park, and special needs such as wheelchair accessibility and sensory features. Ultimately, I think it would be great to have across the country. I feel it would be really useful if someone was traveling and needed to find a park with certain amenities.
### Features
